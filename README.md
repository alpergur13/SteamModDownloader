# SteamModDownloader
This program is designed to download multiple mods. It also tries to download more than one at a time to increase speed.

This simply uses steamcmd to download each mod separately.

# How to use
First of all your folder should look like this.
│── steam/

      └── steamcmd.exe
      
│── SteamModDownloader.exe

│── mods.txt 

After this is ready you should open steamcmd, after it downloades everything it should close after a few seconds. You don't need to open steamcmd every time, once is enough.

Then you must edit mods.txt so first line should be game's steam link like this: https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/

After that you should list all mods' links row by row so in total it should look like this:

After this you can open SteamModDownloader.exe and it will download all mods that you listed. After it finishes mods should be ready in the mods folder. You can transfer them to wherever you want.
